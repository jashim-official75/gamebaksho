            The Terms and Conditions of Service and the End User License Agreement are agreements between you and Play
            Toony. This controls your access to and use of the websites, games, and other interactive software products
            and services that we run and that link to these Terms (collectively, our "Services").
            <br>
            Before using the facilities, please carefully study these terms and conditions. We can change the Terms or
            change, suspend, or end any part of the Services at any time, as long as we do so in accordance with the
            law. If we change these terms, we'll notify you (for example, by posting the new terms on the Services).
            <br>
            <strong> Please be aware that Section X contains a mandatory arbitration clause as well as a class action
              waiver, both of which may affect your rights in the event of a dispute with us.</strong>
            <br>
            <strong> Your permission is needed to sign these terms electronically and store relevant records
              digitally.</strong>

          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Utilization of services</li>
            <p>Restricted License. You can connect to and use the services running on the operating systems on which the
              services are intended to function for your personal, non-commercial, entertainment use only, according to
              these Terms. A limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the services is given to
              you. They are not sold to you. You can't change, edit, or copy the services or any part of them (except
              for a separate reserve copy and a temporary copy needed to run the services), send, upload, run, copy,
              publish, make derivative works from, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, or make available in any other way.
              Without restricting the validity of the above, you accept that you have no right to sell or otherwise
              transfer, in whole or in part, any of the digital objects, digital assets, currencies, points, or any
              other material or information from the Services on internet auction sites (such as eBay or IGE), hacker
              sites, private server sites, gold farming sites, or any other third-party sites or services in exchange
              for anything of value, be it real money or anything else. Other than what is expressly given to you
              according to these Terms, you have no access to or use of the services. If you don't follow any of the
              rules, your license will be taken away right away.</p>

            <h4>Additional Terms:</h4>
            <p>Additional terms, conditions, regulations, or instructions for acceptable use ("Additional Terms") are
              subject to and regulated by some of the services. We will give you access to these additional terms
              through the relevant service. Before you can use the relevant service, you must agree to these additional
              terms. If there are any conventions of this agreement that conflict with any of the terms and conditions
              of the Additional Terms, this agreement shall be superseded by the Additional Terms with respect to the
              topic mentioned in the Additional Terms.
            </p>

            <h4>Qualification:</h4>
            <p>You reflect that, under applicable law, you are not a person excluded from accessing the services. You
              also represent that you are of the appropriate age in your country or that you are using the Services with
              the permission and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who has checked and approved these Conditions
              in accordance with applicable law. Children (as specified by applicable law) may not provide any personal
              information or register an account with Play Toony or other similar services.
            </p>

            <p> For some of our services, you need to sign up for an account with us. You may not be able to access any
              portions or functions of the Services if you are not signed into your account. You can only provide
              correct and complete information when creating an account, and you will promptly update this information.
              You will remain anonymous and safe with your username and password and will not use the same password you
              use with other websites or services. Before transferring the services to any other devices that you will
              install them on, you may uninstall and delete the services from the previous one. You will tell us right
              away if you find or think that someone else has used or accessed your account without your permission.
            </p>

            <h4>Advantages of Play Toony:</h4>
            <p>We do not accept or acknowledge the exchange of accounts between users. You may not purchase, sell,
              refer, or exchange any account and may not propose to do so. Any such effort shall be insignificant and
              void, and may directly result in the account's cancellation and penalization.
            </p>

            <h4>Software Updates:</h4>
            <p> Play Toony will provide you with updates, which are usually made available at its absolute discretion.
              You accept and agree that Play Toony can automatically and remotely deliver updates to you, including
              (without limitation) by accessing the mobile device or PC on which you are using the Services. Any
              notifications issued or made available by Play Toony shall be incorporated into and subject to these Terms
              and Conditions.
            </p>

            <h4>Controls for Export:</h4>
            <p> When using the program, you can abide by all relevant export laws and regulations. The Services, or any
              component thereof, cannot be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (a) to any country in which a
              trade embargo is placed on the United States or (b) to anyone on the United States list of Specially
              Designated Citizens or the U.S. Treasury Department Table of Denial Orders or liable to EU or EU Member

              residing in, or under the jurisdiction of, any such country.
              <br>
              Transfers occur through cross-border channels. By agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you agree fully
              that the enforcement of these Terms and the distribution of the Services entail the transfer of the
              information we obtain from your country to other countries, which may not offer the same degree of
              security as your country of origin or the European Union/European Economic Area.
            </p>
            <li>Contents that users have shared</li>
            <p>You are and will remain entirely liable for all messages, photographs, videos, audio, content, or
              sections of the contents of databases, databases, contents, and any other materials or information that
              you publish or transfer through the Services, including, without exception, any text, voice
              communications, recordings, or gameplay videos (collectively, "User Content").
              <br>
              You reflect and guarantee that the content that you upload or transfer will not:
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Violation of a third party's copyright, trademark, database or other intellectual property rights.
                  You reflect and guarantee that you possess or have the required licenses, privileges, consents and
                  approvals for the uploading or transmission of User Content on the Services, and that the User Content
                  does not infringe any privacy or marketing promotions of the terms or rights of any third party.</li>

                <li>Promoting illegal sweepstakes or tournaments and not promoting any form of lottery or gambling.</li>

                <li>Prevent or hinder the discovery of information relating to the Services by other users.</li>

                <li>Facilitate or encourage activity that includes illicit content, pornography, piracy, unlawful drugs,
                  underage drinking, or socially careless conduct due to alcohol or substance use at Play Toony absolute
                  discretion (such as drinking and driving).</li>

                <li>Teach users how to produce explosives, guns, narcotics, illicit or illegal or dangerous products, or
                  how to participate in violent or illegal conduct or organizations under applicable laws, including,
                  without limitation, terrorist threats or activities.</li>
                <p>
                  You accept and understand that Play Toony may (but not necessarily) manage, track, evaluate, and
                  archive any User Content that you publish, distribute, or make available on or through the Services
                  (that includes the content of your verbal or written communications) and may, without notifying you
                  before and in its private ruling, delete User Content at any moment for any or no reason. You accept
                  that any tracking or logging may be done using software that may be installed to access or use the
                  services when you download software. Play Toony isn't responsible if User Content isn't deleted or if
                  the process of deleting it is interrupted, unless it's required by law. It also has no responsibility
                  or liability for how User Content is used or kept.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  You therefore give Play Toony the privilege and authorization to use your User Content, which is free
                  of royalties, everlasting, irreversible, completely manageable, capable of being sublicensed, not
                  exclusive, universal, and to be used in any and all media for whichever manner and purpose (including,
                  but not limited to, profitable, publicity, and advertising). To be used to the maximum degree
                  allowable by relevant law, including and not limited to the privileges to replicate, alter, execute,
                  showcase, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise communicate to the public, or the production or
                  adaptation, use, or otherwise misuse of derivative works by any means, whether now known or unknown,
                  and without any further notice or reimbursement of any sort to you. You waive, to the degree allowed
                  by applicable law, any moral rights of paternity, publishing, credibility, or attribution with regard
                  to the use and enjoyment of user material by Play Toony and other players in connection with the
                  Services. The issuance of a license to Play Toony and the waiver of any relevant moral rights referred
                  to above shall survive any termination or expiration of the Terms.
                </p>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <li>Knowledgeable Property and Rights of Violation</li>
            <p>Services (including any modifications thereto) are protected by the United States, the European Union,
              and other countries' copyright and other intellectual property legislation. Our trademarks and/or service
              marks are Play Toony and our related logos and names. The trademarks, service marks, labels, and logos of
              their respective owners are other trademarks, service marks, labels, and logos used by or in connection
              with the services. Without our prior written permission, you are not given any right or license with
              respect to any of these trademarks, service marks, or logos. Play Toony holds and maintains all ownership,
              title, and equity in and to the facilities and all aspects thereof, including, without restriction, all
              intellectual property rights.
              <br>
              <br>
              Any content made accessible by the services that has watermarks or is protected by other technology for
              the management of digital rights will limit how you can view and use the services. The Services can access
              and monitor your computer for third-party programs or software that is forbidden under these Terms
              ("Unauthorized Third-Party Software") (including, without limitation, hard drives and other storage
              equipment, central processing units, random access memory, video cards, and peripheral hardware, software,
              and applications). In the circumstance that any prohibited third-party software is found, Play Toony will
              collect additional information, including, without restriction, your user name, descriptions of the
              unauthorized third-party software, and the time and date, as defined in the Play Toony Privacy Policy, and
              may use this information to implement these Terms and Conditions in compliance with the Play Toony Privacy
              Policy.
              <br>
              <br>
              Play Toony is always happy to hear from players and fans, and we welcome reviews and ideas about how to
              improve our services. Any thoughts, opinions, suggestions, comments, reviews, or other inputs (including,
              without restriction, those that provide feedback on or recommend new content, features, products, or
              related ideas on our Services) (collectively, "Feedback") will not be regarded as confidential or
              proprietary, regardless of whether you send such feedback in a public or private medium. This means that
              if you give Play Toony feedback, you forfeit all rights to it and allow it to be shared and used for any
              reason by us or others, including without limitation using, distributing, and commercially exploiting the
              feedback in any manner that we deem fit without warning or reimbursement to you. Play Toony does not
              respond to or often think about the reviews we get, and it is not their job to include any feedback about
              you.
              <br>
              We value others' rights to intellectual property. If you have reason to believe that your copyrighted work
              or other intellectual property has been infringed and is accessible through our services, you can notify
              our designated agent by submitting the following information in writing via the contact information
              provided below:
              <ul>
                <li>Identification of the work or intellectual property that has been patented or of a sample collection
                  of works or property alleged to have been infringed.</li>
                <li>Identification of the content suspected to be violating and fairly adequate knowledge to permit us
                  to locate the material.</li>
                <li>Your identity, contact details and email address, so that we can contact you if necessary.</li>
                <li>An assertion that the material found in the document is correct and that the suing party is
                  entitled, under penalty of perjury, to act on behalf of the holders of an exclusive right which is
                  allegedly infringed.</li>
                <li>A determination that you have a good faith conviction that the owner of the intellectual property,
                  its representative, or the statute is not allowed to use the content in the manner complained of.</li>
                <li>A tangible or electronic signature of a person allowed to act on behalf of the proprietor of an
                  allegedly infringed exclusive right. </li>
              </ul>

              <p> If the content is deleted, the person who uploaded it will be notified that it was deleted due to the
                suspected violation. We may give out your contact information, such as your email address and the name
                of your company or customer, as well as the results of your survey. If the group that posted the content
                feels that the material may not have been deleted, they may be allowed to contact you individually to
                attempt to fix the problem, and under existing legislation, they will be entitled to send a
                counter-notification. We revoke the rights of consumers that breach intellectual property laws
                repeatedly.</p>
            </p>

            <li>Digital currency and digital items</li>

            <p> You can visit online and in-game stores when using the facilities, where you can obtain and use Xoss
              Games' virtual currency and downloadable, in-game objects (including early access to games still in
              production, as may be offered from time to time). In conjunction with the use of the facilities, Xoss
              Games can also make points available to you.
              <br>
              <strong>DIGITAL CONTENTS, LIKE VIRTUAL CONTENTS TRADED FOR PREPAID PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS
                GOODS OR SERVICES, NOT AS PREPAID PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS.</strong> There is no "real-world" value for
              virtual currencies and points, but in-game items can be exchanged. Things from those retailers are not
              bought by you but licensed to you under these conditions instead. Irrespective of the delivery specified
              or remuneration received in return for virtual money, you have no ownership rights in the virtual currency
              objects purchased.
              <br>
              Any rates, estimates, and specifications made or referred to in our services do not constitute a bid and
              can be removed or modified at any time prior to the express approval by Play Toony of your request. You
              consent to pay, to the degree allowed by applicable statute, all costs, fees, and applicable taxes paid by
              you or any other person using your account or arising from the use of the Services on your computer at the
              price(s) in place at the time of those charges. Play Toony can change the prices of their services at any
              time as long as they are in line with the law. Play Toony has the right to let you know about any mistakes
              in the description of the product or in the price before the product is sent out. If this occurs, and you
              wish to proceed with the order fulfillment, you agree that the goods or services will be delivered in
              accordance with the updated definition or price corrected above.
              <br>
              You will be able to access different payment types, such as credit card, direct debit, PayPal, etc., while
              accessing virtual currencies through the Services. When you use third-party payment and billing services,
              such as PayPal, the additional terms, conditions, and costs of the service apply. Any federal, state, and
              local taxes involved with the receipt or use of the interactive goods you buy from Play Toony are your
              responsibility to pay.
              <br>
              Depending on the type of sale, there may be minimums and maximums for how much you can buy or sell with
              virtual currencies. Play Toony has the right to change, at any time and without notice, the minimum and
              maximum amounts that can be spent when using virtual currencies, so that they are in line with the law.
              <br>
              <strong>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Play Toony
                WILL NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCIES OR DIGITAL, IN-GAME GOODS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS,
                INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT, THESE TERMS, OR THE
                FACILITIES. </strong>
              <br>
              If an account is banned for good, it will lose all content licenses and virtual currency balances. Xoss
              Games will not be responsible or liable to you and will not give you back any virtual money, points,
              products, or experiences you lost because you broke the rules.
              <br>
              Objects may expire. Any item you buy with virtual currency or points will be added to your account before
              the item, these terms, or the facilities expire. Rates and availability of items can change at any time
              and without notice, as required by law.
              <br>
              We may decide to close your account if a charge you give us permission to make to your credit card or
              SMS/phone billing cannot be processed, is returned to us unpaid, or is to refunded for any reason, and if
              that happens, you must automatically pay us for that charge using another credit card or another method of
              payment. We are not responsible or liable for any fees or fines that you may have to pay because of your
              credit card or bank. We reserve the right to limit the number of an item you can order or refuse to sell
              you an item at any time and without notice. Prior to our approval thereof, you can be asked to check the
              transaction records.
              <br>
              Regardless of the various Clauses, the laws of your country that apply to the purchase of virtual products
              and services from Play Toony may provide rights or remedies that are available in addition to, or to the
              extent that, the rights or remedies set out in these Terms are in conflict with, or instead of, those
              provided for under such laws.</p>

            <li>Code of Behaviour</li>
            <p>

            <p>You agree that, no matter where you come from, the United Nations Agreement on Contracts for the Sale of
              Goods does not apply. This is true even if you don't look at the rules about how different laws interact
              with each other. You agree, to the fullest extent allowed by law, that these Terms and Conditions shall be
              read and entered into in accordance with the laws of the country listed in the table below, on the basis
              of which the Play Toony body provides the services in force. You agree to apply to the individual and

                  LITIGATE CASES BEFORE A LAWSUIT AND TO MAKE A JUDGE OR JURY DETERMINE YOUR CASE BY COMMITTING TO
                  BINDING ARBITRATION.</strong>
                <br>
                Play Toony and you all agree that any civil or equitable argument, conflict, litigation, or proceeding
                arising from or relating to the Facilities ('Dispute') will be settled to the fullest degree allowed by
                statute in order to expedite and regulate the expense of disputes:</p>
            </p>

            <h4>Announcement of Disagreement:</h4>
            <p> You or we must supply the other party with a Notice of Dispute" in the case of a dispute, which is a formal document setting forth the identity, location, and contact information of the party giving it, the details giving rise to the conflict, and a suggested remedy. You must mail and email any Notice of Conflict to us at the mailing addresses and email addresses given in the Contact Us section. If we have it, we will give you any Note of Conflict by post to your address or otherwise to your email address.</p>

            <h4>Minor Entitlements Court:</h4>
            <p>If the case satisfies all the requirements to be heard in small claims court (or the equivalent), you may opt to litigate the dispute in small claims court (or the equivalent) in the jurisdiction stated in Section IX.</p>

            <h4>Obligatory Settlement:</h4>
            <p>In small claims cases, where the conflict is not settled, all further attempts to settle the dispute will be carried out solely through binding arbitration, as defined in this section. You give up the right to litigate all cases in court before a judge or jury (or engage in them as a party or class member). Instead, all disputes will be decided before a neutral arbitrator whose verdict will be binding, with the exception of the restricted right of appeal provided for under the Federal Arbitration Act or some other relevant statute. The arbitrator's award will be imposed by any court having authority over the parties.</p>

            <h4>Exclusions to Settlement:</h4>
            <p>In small claims cases, where the conflict is not settled, all further attempts to settle the dispute will be carried out solely through binding arbitration, as defined in this section. You give up the right to litigate all cases in court before a judge or jury (or engage in them as a party or class member). Instead, all disputes will be decided before a neutral arbitrator whose verdict will be binding, with the exception of the restricted right of appeal provided for under the Federal Arbitration Act or some other relevant statute. The arbitrator's award will be imposed by any court having authority over the parties.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>  Any conflicts attempting to impose or defend, or pertaining to the value of, any of your intellectual property rights or those of Play Toony.</li>

              <li>Any injunctive relief claim.</li>

              <li>Any allegation you are entitled to bring to the notice of any department of federal, state, or local government that may allow such agencies to request redress from us on your behalf, if the law permits.</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Class Action Waiver:</h4>
            <p>Any court action to settle a dispute or go to court would be done on an individual basis. Neither you nor we would try to get any case heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which any side acts in a legislative capacity or intends to act. Until the parties have given their prior written consent, no arbitration or prosecution shall be merged with another.</p>

            <h4>Settlement Measures:</h4>
            <p>This arbitration will be done by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS) in accordance with the customer or commercial arbitration laws that are in effect at the time the case is filed. If JAMS is unable or unwilling to perform arbitration of the conflict, all sides may voluntarily negotiate with an alternative arbitration service provider. By following the JAMS rules, you can order a telephonic or in-person hearing. In a case costing $10,000 or less, regardless of whether the arbitrator sees good reason to hold an in-person hearing instead, the hearing would be telephonic. The arbitrator can personally award the same damages to you as a court would. The arbitrator can only help you, and only to the extent that is necessary for your claim to be satisfied.</p>

            <h4>Arbitrator’s Jurisdiction:</h4>
            <p>The arbitrator shall have the authority to decide on the existence, extent, or legitimacy of the arbitration arrangement or the arbitrability of any argument or counterclaim, including any objection to his or her own jurisdiction.</p>

            <h4>Arbitration Fees: </h4>
            <p>The original arbitration fee is paid by whoever files the arbitration. We pay if we file. When you apply, you pay unless, under the applicable arbitration rules, you get a charge waiver. The other payments will be split up according to the rules set by the arbitration firm and the law. - regardless of which party prevails, a party shall pay the costs of that party's counsel, consultants, and witnesses, as well as other expenditures, unless the arbitrator, following relevant law, so decides, a party may reclaim any or all expenses from another party.</p>

            <h4>Disagreements Must Be Filed Within One Year:</h4>
            <p>To the degree allowed by statute, any dispute pursuant to this arrangement must be filed in a small claims court or arbitration proceeding within one year. The one-year cycle starts when it is practicable to file the dispute or notice of dispute first. If, after one year, a dispute is not filed, it is automatically barred.</p>

            <h4>Provisional Injunctive Relief:</h4>
            <p>Before an arbitrator is chosen, any party can ask any court with the right authority for temporary injunctive relief without giving up its right to arbitration.</p>

            <p>If this arbitration arrangement is considered to be unconstitutional or unenforceable, the parties agree to the fullest degree permissible under relevant statute that, in compliance with Section IX, any disagreement relating to your use of the facilities or these provisions shall be instituted and heard.</p>

            <li>Miscellaneous </li>

            <h4>All-inclusive Agreement:</h4>
            <p>These terms represent a whole arrangement between you and us, superseding all previous or contemporaneous (oral, literary, or electronic) correspondence and suggestions between you and us.</p>

            <h4>Relationship of the Parties:</h4>
            <p>You agree that there is no joint venture, collaboration, job, or organization between you and us because of these terms or because you have access to and use the facilities.</p>

            <h4>Severability:</h4>
            <p>This clause shall be severed if any provision of these terms of service is considered to be unconstitutional or unenforceable. The majority of the terms and conditions will remain in full force and effect. An enforceable provision that comes closest to the purpose behind the invalid provision will override the severed provision.</p>

            <h4>Assignment:</h4>
            <p>Without the prior written permission of Play Toony, this arrangement will not be assigned, in whole or in part, whether knowingly, by statute, or otherwise, to you. Play Toony may, without constraint, assign, authorize, delegate, or otherwise transfer to any third party its rights or obligations under this clause. Except for what was said in the last sentence, the rights and responsibilities of the parties to this Agreement are binding on the parties and their respective successors and authorized assigns, and they will protect them against any attempt to assign something other than what is written in this section.</p>

            <h4>Captions and headings:</h4>
            <p>The titles and headings of the sections and paragraphs used in the Terms are only there for your convenience. They do not change the way the Terms are meant to be read or understood.</p>

            <h4>Waiver:</h4>
            <p>If we don't enforce or respond to someone breaking any of the rules in these Terms, we don't lose our right to do so later.</p>
