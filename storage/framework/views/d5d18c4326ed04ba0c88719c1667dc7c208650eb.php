            police to look into and fix these practices, as well as to follow our Terms of Service and End User License
            Agreement.

            partners, please contact us.</p>

          <h2>Other Users:</h2>
          <p>Your identity, including your username and any images you may share, and information about your actions on

          <h2>Legal Reasons:</h2>
          <p>We may share your information with third parties if we think it's required by law or if regulators or law enforcement officials tell us to.

            </p>

          <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
         <p>When you use our services or interact with emails from us, we and our third-party business partners can collect and store information about how you use them. These technologies include cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other similar tools.
          <br>
          Cookies are small files that are created automatically and stored on your computer when you visit a website. Pixel tags are very small images or small bits of data that are embedded in images. They can get information from your browser about cookies, the time and date you visit a page, a summary of the page where the pixel tag is, and other similar things. Pixel tags are also called "internet beacons" or "clear GIFs." Local storage, except that it can store larger amounts of information and can be stored elsewhere on your device, is similar to a cookie.
          <br>
          For the following functions and purposes, we use cookies and similar technologies (collectively, "cookies"):
          </p>

          <h2>Analytics and Research</h2>
         <p>In order to collect information on how visitors use our services, we use analytics and research cookies, including to determine the total number of individuals using our services and the types of devices they use. We might use the information to put together reports with aggregated and de-identified information and to help make our services better.</p>

          <h2>Authentication</h2>
         <p>These cookies help us identify our users so that you can fully enjoy the services and features when you sign in. These cookies are essential and cannot be blocked if you want to use the services.</p>

          <h2>Service Features and Performance</h2>
         <p>We use cookies to collect information about how our services operate. We may use the information to compile reports and help improve the services.</p>

          <h2>Security and Service Integrity</h2>
         <p>We use security-based cookies to help ensure the safety of our services. We may use information obtained from security and service integrity cookies to identify, among other things, possible fraudulent or abusive activities, to enforce our Terms of Service and End User License Agreement, and to protect the safety of our users. These cookies are essential and cannot be blocked if you want to use the services.</p>

          <h2>Advertising</h2>
         <p>
          We use advertising cookies to optimize the advertisements shown to you on the services and on third-party websites and services.
          <br>
          We allow third parties, including our analytics vendors, advertising networks, and other advertising service providers, to gather information about your use of the services through your apps and your multiple devices using cookies and similar technologies. These third parties may use this information to view advertising on our websites and elsewhere online through a variety of sites and services customized to your interests, preferences, and characteristics. For this reason, you will monitor the use and disclosure of knowledge through your choices.
          <br>
          <strong> YOU CONSENT TO THE USE OF NON-ESSENTIAL COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNICAL MEANS AND DEFINED IN THE PRIVACY POLICY WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PROTECTION OF THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION TO THE LATER REFUSE TO THE USE.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>Your Choices</h2>
         <p>
          Play Toony gives you a number of ways to control how your information is used and shared, such as:
          </p>

          <h2>Communications by email: </h2>
         <p>
          If you don't want to get commercial emails from us, you can unsubscribe by following the steps in our emails. Please note that you can still get messages about your account, your purchases, and other service-related things even if you have chosen not to get commercial emails.
          </p>

          <h2>Data for Geolocation: </h2>
         <p>
          Through the settings on your device, you can keep an eye on how your precise geolocation data is collected and whether or not it is shared with third parties. Please note that you will need to change more than just your location permissions if you don't want to share your exact location. If you choose not to give us accurate geolocation information, we may still be able to figure out where you are based on your IP address and other information we collect. Please check your computer settings for more details.
          </p>

          <h2>Similar technologies and cookies: </h2>
         <p>
          By changing your web browser settings, you can reject or disable cookies. Since each web browser is different, please look in the "help" section of your web browser for instructions. Please keep in mind that you will need to take extra steps to reject or turn off local storage and similar technologies. For example, Adobe Local Shared Objects can be managed by following the steps on the Adobe Setting Manager page. In some cases, deleting your browser's cookies can cancel your interest-based advertising options. If you choose to block, disable, or remove cookies and other similar technologies, you might not be able to use any of the services' features anymore.
          </p>

          <h2>Signals and similar tools should not be tracked.</h2>
         <p>
          Some web browsers can send "do not track" signals to the websites that the user visits. Currently, Naptech Games is not taking action in response to these signals.
          </p>

          <h2>Interest-Based Advertising:</h2>
         <p>
          You can't turn off all ads, but you can choose whether or not you get interest-based ads over time and on different devices based on what you do online and what you like. You can choose not to get interest-based ads from companies that are part of self-regulatory groups like the Network Advertising Initiative (US), the Digital Advertising Alliance (US), the EDAA (EU), and the DAAC (Canada) by following the instructions on their websites. You will also need to opt out of interest-based ads on your mobile device or via the mobile application if you are using a mobile app. Check the settings on your computer and mobile app for more detail. Please note that when you opt out, your opt-out option will apply only to the browser and computer that you are using.
          </p>

          <h2>Other Game and Device Permissions: </h2>
         <p>
          You may be able to change your privacy settings within the services or your system permissions for push alerts, address book sharing, and other details or functions. For more details, please check the settings for the services and your computer. To stop a Naptech Games game from collecting information, you can uninstall it using the standard uninstall process on your computer or through the software marketplace or network where you got the game.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Rights and Withdrawing Consent:  </h2>
         <p>
          Depending on the laws in your country, you may be able to ask for access to, change, block, port, copy, or remove your information. You may also be able to ask us to stop using your information or delete your account, or you may be able to withdraw or change the scope of your consent. If you take back your permission, we won't use your information for certain things, but it won't change how we use the information that was already protected by your permission. If you ask us in a reasonable way, we will move your data where it is technically possible and required by law. You might not be able to use the services or any of their features if you ask to withdraw your consent, limit or stop processing your information, or delete your account or information. Please contact us in order to exercise your rights consistent with applicable law.
          </p>

          <h2>Minors</h2>
         <p>
          Without permission from a parent or unless the law allows it, we don't collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or whatever age is set by the law).
          </p>

          <h2>How We Protect Information and How Long We Secure Information</h2>
         <p>
          We keep your information safe by using physical, electronic, organizational, and procedural safeguards that are reasonable and right for the job. Even though we take reasonable steps to keep data from being lost, misused, or accessed by people who shouldn't, we can't guarantee the security of any storage system or data transmission over the internet. The information we get will only be kept for as long as it makes sense for the purposes listed above, unless the law says otherwise.

          <h2>International Data Transfer</h2>
         <p>
          Because of what this privacy policy says, the information we get from you may be sent to countries other than the one you live in. You agree that Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India, Russia, and Latin America may not have the same level of privacy protection as your home country, and you agree to the transfer of your data to these countries for processing in accordance with their privacy laws. These transfers are necessary for us to offer our services and follow the Terms of Service and End User License Agreement.
          </p>

          <h2>Alterations to this Privacy Policy</h2>
         <p>
          We can change this privacy policy at any time. If we do, we will notify you before the changes take effect by posting the new policy on the Services or in another legally permissible manner. Any amendments to this privacy policy, as set out in the notice of such changes, will take effect after a reasonable period of time.
          </p>

          <h2>Contact Us</h2>
         <p>
          The privacy of your information and its protection are of the utmost importance.
