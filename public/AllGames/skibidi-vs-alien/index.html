	<meta name="description" content="Skibidi Vs. Alien is an endless runner survival game where you play as Skibidi, a young alien who must dance his way through a series of challenging levels in order to defeat the evil aliens who have invaded his planet. The game is simple to play but difficult to master. You control Skibidi by tapping the screen to make him jump and slide. You must avoid obstacles and enemies while collecting power-ups to help you stay alive. The levels get progressively more difficult as you progress, and you will need to use all of your skills to survive.">
